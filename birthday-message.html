        <h1 contenteditable>Disclaimer </h1>
        <p>
            Don't call me this night!!!!!<br>
            And don't forget that you aren't gonna tell anyone and show it to anyone, what I made for you. I made it with love and it's special.<br><br><br>
            
            I knew it was going to happen, but I didn't think it would happen right from the start 😩😳<br>
            As tears roll down I write this, I want you to know just how special you are to me 🫣🤗🤭<br>
            You know how much I hate writing or designing, but I would do anything to make you feel special, even if
            it's something I don't enjoy💘<br>
            I hope this makes you smile and makes you feel special🪄<br>
        </p>




        <h1 contenteditable>&#10084; A beautiful Journey &#10084;</h1>
        <p> Here we are once again, far from where we started. The journey has been beautiful because it was with
            YOU.<br>
            The saying is true: it's not about the destination or the journey, but about the person you're with
            &#128519;💐<br><br>
            From flirting with each other, laughing together, crying in front of each other, to coming very close, to
            not talking as much, we've come a long way🥺<br>

            From pani-puri dates to enjoying the rains we spent some great time 💎<br><br>

            From my name saved in your phone as 'MIT Aviral Div S' to 'Aaviraallll' to 'Aviral,' we've shared so much
            and so much's changed.<br>

            From being your friend to being your teacher we played many roles in each other's lives.<br><br>

            From talking every night to barely speaking, it's been an emotional transition for me.<br>

            From your random calls to say 'I Love You Aviral' to mostly talking when we need something, it's been a
            rollercoaster.<br><br>

            From giving you flowers and chocolates to giving you my heart, I expressed my love for you in tiny-tiny
            things 🍫💐❤<br>

            From being the second person you'd call for anything to now not knowing much about you, I wished for being
            the first.<br><br>

            From making pretty memories with YOU to making YOU one of the most wonderful chapters of my life, you
            charmed me✨✨✨<br>


            From always looking out for each other to avoiding each other, it has been hurtful.<br>

            Yet, it has been a beautiful journey for me because it was with YOU 💕😘



        </p>




        <h1 contenteditable>&#10084; Your Importance &#10084;</h1>
        <p> I won't write much here because you know how I see you, the prettiest, hottest, and sexiest girl I know🤩😏
            <br>
            I wish you could see yourself through my eyes because every time I try to describe you, I fail to
            justify.<br><br>

            You have made a special place for yourself in my heart and it will always be for you 💖🔒<br>

            I know you are sensitive and overthink a lot, and I am the same. I always worry about hurting you.<br>
            You should know that you are very important to me, and I couldn't imagine anyone else by my side.<br><br>

            How much you mean to me is beyond words.<br>
            I know it's been a while since I expressed it or made you feel prioritized and special.<br>

            But you should know that you are one of the very few people I confide in 🌷<br>
            If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have been here. So don't ever think that Aviral doesn't care about
            Jineshi ❤<br><br>

            I know I upset you all the time, but it's just me. I struggle with friendships...😔<br><br>

        </p>


        <h1 contenteditable>&#10084; The Unexpressed love &#10084;</h1>

        <p>
            I know I don't express it often, but I love you a lot and sometimes even go crazy thinking about you 💫<br>
            Most of the time, I find myself thinking about you, and many times your thoughts put a smile 😳<br>
            I like you so much and am so attracted to you that I can't explain 🙁💞<br>
            You are the only person I feel like being with all the time 🥺<br>
            I know I don't talk much, but I feel comfortable with you even in silence. There are hardly any people I
            feel this way with.<br>
            I don't know if you realize it, but when you hug only me in front of everyone, it makes me feel special
            🫂🥺<br>
            I miss your hugs, you know why(hehehehe) 😋🤤🎈<br><br>

            Love you the most Jineshi 🩷❤🧡💛<br>
            Love you the most my princess 💚🩵💙💜<br>
            Love you the most my doll 🧸💝<br>
            Love you the most my billi 🐱😽<br><br>

            Take care Birthday Girl 😘💋<br>
        </p>
